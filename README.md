This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game using Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer in an interactive and fun way. The computer randomly selects its move, and the player enters their choice via keyboard input. After each round, the program determines the winner based on traditional rules:

 Rock beats Scissors
 Scissors beats Paper
 Paper beats Rock

The program includes input validation to ensure the player enters a valid choice, and can be extended to include score tracking, multiple rounds, or even a graphical interface.
